# react_portfolio

<br> This project was to create a portfolio webpage using React.
<br> To get things started, I used a React tutorial by Lama Dev for creating a personal page.
<br> The tutorial can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WwtzsSHdpI&t=301s

# Attributes

<br> When the user visits the page they are brought to the introduction page by default
<br> The nav bar incorporates a side bar using conditional state for displaying and styling
<br> Snap scrolling is used to separate the different sections of the page
<br> When the user clicks on the differetn sections from the sidebar menu they are taken to that section of the webpage.
